If you need to look up tracking information, suggest the customer use the tracking number from their email and check the carrier's website (faqs[12]/answer). If the tracking information isn't updating, see the resolution for ticket t4g5h6i7-8901-2345-abcd-ef5678901234.  If it's a delivery delay or customs issue, more information is needed to assist.\n",
